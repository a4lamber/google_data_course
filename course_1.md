### Transforming data into insights
The 6 steps for data analysis process explained in this program is

> One of the many things that makes data analytics so exciting is that the problems are always different, the solutions need creativity, and the impact on others can be great.

### Understanding the data eco-system

It's important to go against the **gut feeling** since it will introduce bias.

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{data} + \mathrm{business\quad knowledge} = \mathrm{mystery 
\quad solved}
\end{equation*}
$$

不管是去哪个领域，domain-specific knowledge都是非常重要的，因为这都是解决问题的一部分，对于很多领域的知识，一部分是业内才知道的轻重缓急和行业痛点和核心难点，另一部分是统计的基础和知识，但data以及how to get data to the right people efficiently是非常重要的.

Let's get back to google's data analytics process or mindset:
- `Ask`: Business challenge/objective/question
- `Prepare`: Data generation, collection, storage and data management
- `Process`: Data cleaning/data integrity
- `Analyze`: Data exploration, visualization and analysis
- `Share`: Communicating and interpreting results.
- `Act`: Putting ur insights to work to solve the problem.

那我在SHPT的工作也可以说是完成了一个`data analysis life cycle`了, 真心希望接下去的部分能顺利进行下去.



Key questions help analysts test whether they have accomplished enough to move forward and ensure that teams have spent enough time on each of the phases and `don’t start modeling before the data is ready`. It is a little different from the data analysis life cycle this program is based on, but it has some core ideas in common: the first phase is interested in discovering and asking questions; 

很多时候企业运行的太快，目标太急太赶，都没办法停下来思考.

除了google的这数据分析的`data analysis life cycle`，其它公司和人都提出了类似的开发循环和周期,但大同小异.

## Week2

### Embracing your data analyst skills

Five essential aspects of analytical skills,

- Curiosity 
- Understand context 
- A techanical mindset
  - Break down an action into smaller steps.
- Data design
  - How you organize information.
- Data strategy
  - Management of the people, processes and tools used in data analysis.


Although you are using those tools extensively in your daily life, you still need to fill in the necessary and specific skills for the job.


### Thinking about analytical thinking

> Thinking is 2nd nature to us, but we rarely think about thinking.

`Analytical thinking` has 5 elemments:
- **visualization**: graphical visualization is better than
- **strategy**:
- **problem-oriented**: 
- **correlation**: Rainy season correlates with umberla sales boost. But remember, correlation doesn't mean causation.
- **big picture yet detail oriented**:

> `Root cause`: the reason why a problem occurs. a common solution to find root cause is to ask yourself why 5 times.


> `Gap analysis`: a method for examining and evaulating how a process works currently to get to where you want to be in the future.



### Using data to drive successful outcomes

`Data-driven decision-making`: using facts to guide business strategy.

这个例子很有意思`google human resource`通过一系列措施来判断扁平化管理和有manager哪个更好.
